A quality testerâ€™s behaviour is described by the GSPN in the figure. The code 
constructs the CTMC representing the GSPNs behaviour. It also calculates the steady state
probabilities and throughout values for different discretization time steps.

Note: In each time step, one item is produced, the probability for the item to test OK is 
0.9 for source 0 and 0.95 for source 1.
